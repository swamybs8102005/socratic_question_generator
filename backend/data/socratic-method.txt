# Socratic Teaching Method

## Core Principles
The Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking.

## Question Types

### Clarification Questions
Used to understand what the learner means or knows. Examples:
- "What do you mean by that?"
- "Can you explain that in different words?"
- "What specifically are you asking about?"

### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
Provide options to test understanding:
- Present 4 options labeled A-D
- Mix correct and plausible incorrect answers
- Use to validate baseline comprehension

### Probing Questions
Dig deeper into reasoning:
- "What evidence supports that?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "How did you arrive at that conclusion?"

### Evidence-Based Questions
Ask learners to justify with facts:
- "What data supports your claim?"
- "Can you cite a source?"
- "Where did you learn that?"

### Critical Thinking Questions
Require analysis and synthesis:
- "How does this compare to...?"
- "What are the implications?"
- "What counterarguments exist?"

## Adaptation Strategy
Start with clarification and MCQs to establish baseline. Progress to deeper question types as understanding improves. Return to basics when confusion is detected.

## Never Provide Answers
The teacher guides through questions, never gives direct answers. This encourages independent thinking and deeper learning.
