# Mastra Memory System

## Overview
Mastra supports three types of memory: working memory, conversation history, and semantic recall.

## Working Memory
Working memory stores persistent user-specific details such as names, preferences, goals, and other structured data. This is implemented as a block of Markdown text or as a Zod schema that the agent can update over time.

## Conversation History
Conversation history captures recent messages from the current conversation, providing short-term continuity and maintaining dialogue flow.

## Semantic Recall
Semantic recall retrieves older messages from past conversations based on semantic relevance. Matches are retrieved using vector search and can include surrounding context for better comprehension.

## Memory Scoping
All memory types are thread-scoped by default, meaning they apply only to a single conversation. Resource-scoped configuration allows working memory and semantic recall to persist across all threads that use the same user or entity.

## Storage Adapters
To persist and recall information between conversations, memory requires a storage adapter. Supported options include LibSQL, MongoDB, Postgres, and Upstash.
